# Quizgame
This repository hosts the backend for the MCQ Game Series, a platform where users can create accounts and participate in multiple-choice quizzes.
Each question in the quiz is assigned a point value that increases with its difficulty level.
An accumulator is used to calculate the user's score as they progress. 
If a user answers a question incorrectly, the correct answer is displayed immediately.
Furthermore, a bubble sort algorithm is implemented to sort and display the high scores in a user list.
